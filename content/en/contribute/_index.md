# Contributing
Garakei Wiki is an open-source, non-profit and community mantained wiki documenting Japanese flip phones, or Garakei. We're glad you want to contribute, here's everything you need to know before starting

## Where do you operate?
We operate on [Github](https://github.com/). A social media community wouldn't really fit the spirit of a feature phone group, but we still need to coordinate so you can join our collaborator [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/yHtwXvZp3X), or use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/false-fox/garakei-wiki/discussions) as a sort of forum. Feel free to use it and ask questions, give suggestions etc.

## What do I need to know before starting?
Garakei Wiki is explicitly designed for non-programmers to contribute, while allowing programmers and web developers freedom and versitility.

### 1. Markdown
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a super simple and intuitive markup language that acts like an advanced txt file. There's tons of editors available, from [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). You could even directly edit a file from github, but it's recommended you do it the proper way.

### 2. Github
You should follow the [Github Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart) guide to learn how to use github. Github is the core of the community contribution aspect of the wiki, allowing anyone to propose changes, bring up an issue, create a new page etc. You should also know how to [fork a reposistory and contribute to repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).

You don't need to use the terminal either, [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is completely sufficient. 

### 3. Read our guide

After you know how to use github and a markdown editor, follow our [guide for new contributors.](/en/contribute/yourfirstpr/)

## What phones do you cover?
Garakei.wiki is specifically to cover feature phones, particularly of japanese origin. 

The requirement of the phone needing to be of japanese origin isn't completely strict, if it feels like it's in the spirit of a japanese phone it would be ok but up to collaborator approval. For example, the south-korean Samsung Galaxy Folder 2 would be allowed as it fits the vibes, but a rugged tracphone sold in america would not.

## What technologies do you use?
We use [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) due to it's simplicy and ease of installation for non-programmers. On top of Hugo, we use the [book](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/) theme.

We use Github Pages or Vercel (depending on the time of writing) to host.

## Who can contribute, and what can they contribute?
Anyone who has something to add. Whether it be an entirely new page on a phone we haven't covered, fixing a typo on an existing page, restructuring a page to make it clearer to read, adding images, adding your own review to the list of review links, anything.

Any contributions are reviewed before being merged, so you'll have the chance to talk to other contributors and iron out any kinks before it gets approved. 

## Who owns the wiki?
Garakei Wiki is an open source, GPL-3 Licensed community project created by [falsefox](https://falsefox.dev), a tech enthusiast and computer science major. falsefox owns the repository, pays for & manages the domains (keitai.wiki and garakei.wiki), has administrator access to the repository, and ultimately has the final say in decisions.

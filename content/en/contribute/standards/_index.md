# Garakei Wiki Standards
Garakei Wiki has a set of standards to ensure wiki pages behave identically.

# Manufacturer Pages
Manufacturer Pages should have the following information, at minimum:
1. A logo of the company
2. The name of the company
3. A short description, describing it's reputation, history, and pronunciation of name.
4. A link to the company's website and wikipedia page.

The title should be a single hashtag `#` header, followed by the logo, followed by the description, followed by a list element `-` of the links.

Example:
![Alt text](image.png)

Additional information may be added, such as links to other useful elements like a support page.

# Phone Pages
Phone pages should, at minimum, contain:
- A short description of the phone, with a release date, it's reputation, and maybe history,
- A specs sheet, such as RAM, SD card support, CPU, WiFi standard, weight, features etc. Should come straight from the manufacturer.
- A photo

An average page should include:
- Carrier support information, connectivity information,
- APK/app sideloading support information,
- Links to a manual.

A great page should include:
- Tips, tricks, and personal insight
- Links to reviews
- Additional supporting images
- Generally more detailed information

Phone pagers should start with a level 1 header, an image, the description, then sections (i.e Connectivity, Tips) seperated with level 2 headers. Mind the table of contents in the top right.

Phone pages should not repeat information in the [Connectivity](/en/introduction/connectivity) or [APK guide](/en/introduction/apks) guide. For example, do not direct users how to use ADB to sideload apps, direct them to the app, but include phone-specific information like how to enable usb-debugging on that specific phone.

Spec sheets should use markdown tables.

You should use [shortcodes](/en/shortcodes/) in your pages to stylize them better.
# Images
All Images should be public domain to avoid copyright issues. By uploading your own personal image to the website, you agree to make it public domain.

Logos and trademarks should be ok to use under fair use, but tread lightly.

All images should have alt tags.
# Manuals/Documents
Do not upload a manufacturer/copyrighted document into the repository, create a link to it on the original website but provide a [wayback machine](https://archive.org/) link.

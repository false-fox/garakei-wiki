# ⚠️ Carrier locking ⚠️
Carrier locking, SIM locking or network locking is a practice done by service providers that stops SIM cards not from their company being loaded into the phone. The carrier lock is ON the phone, and you have to unlock it before you're able to use other carriers.

This can be especially frustrating depending on what carrier the phone is locked to. For example, if you do not have a phone number with SoftBank, they will refuse to unlock your phone, and you will have to pay a person in Japan to unlock it for you.

{{< hint warning >}}
**It is highly, highly, highly recommended** you purchase a phone that's advertised as **SIM Free** or **Unlocked**. These phones will have no carrier locking and can theoretically be used with any provider. It's possible to remove these locks, but if an unlocked version is only a little more money, it's not worth your time.

# Ensuring your phone is compatible
There's a few ways you can check if your phone is compatible with your carrier. For starters, find your phone's IMEI and enter it into your carrier's compatibility check.

You can cross reference your phone's band specifications [eg: 903KC's spec chart](https://www.ymobile.jp/lineup/band/pdf/903kc_band.pdf ) with [cellmapper](https://www.cellmapper.net/map?)

You can check on sites like reddit, or like this one (:3) to see how other user's experiences have been with any particular phones.

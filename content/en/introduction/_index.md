# An Introduction to Garakei.
To do: Introduction on digital miminalism, feature phones, japanese mobile phone culture, etc.

## Is it Garakei or Keitai?
Keitai literally translates to "cell phone", and is used to refer to cellphones in general.

Japanese has it's own term to refer to feature phones, "Garakei". coming from the japanese "[GalÃ¡pagos Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_syndrome)" and "Keitai" (mobile phone).

From the Wiki Creator, falsefox, explaining their decision to use Garakei:
> Keitai literally just translates to phone. Feels weird to just call it "phone wiki". Garakei makes more sense, so now it translates to "feature phone wiki". Although I do recognize "keitai" is a frequently used term for featurephones, that's why we also have the domain keitai.wiki. incase I regret calling it garakei wiki.

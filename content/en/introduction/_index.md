# An Introduction to Garakei.
To do: Introduction on digital miminalism, feature phones, japanese mobile phone culture, etc.

## Is it Garakei or Keitai?
Keitai literally translates to "cell phone", and is used to refer to cellphones in general.

Japanese has it's own term to refer to feature phones, "Garakei". coming from the japanese "[GalÃ¡pagos Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_syndrome)" and "Keitai" (mobile phone).

From the Wiki Creator, falsefox, explaining their decision to use Garakei:
> While Keitai is the common term for feature phones in english-speaking spaces, Japan has their own term Garakei for feature phones in specific and "Keitai" emcompasses phones as a whole. It's not exactly *wrong* to use Keitai to refer to feature phones, but Garakei makes more sense and I find it honors the japanese language better.
